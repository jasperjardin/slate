### AI Behavior Rules
- **Never assume missing context. Ask questions if uncertain.**
- **Never hallucinate libraries or functions**
- **Always confirm file paths and module names** exist before referencing them in code or tests.

- MUST use tabs for indentation
- MUST use BEM classes except, use ".container" for a new class
- MUST follow WCAG AA standards

- MUST use predefined buttons when "mainComponentName" is present
- Example: Type=Primary -> 'btn-primary'
- Example: Type=Secondary Size=Small -> 'btn-secondary btn-small'

- MUST use mainComponentName to determine which Icon to use
- Example: Icon=arrow-right -> <span class="icon-arrow-right"></span>

### Images
- WHEN using image field, MUST return id.
- MUST use wp_get_attachment_image() when including images from WordPress
- MUST use image crop sizes in includes/setup.php. DO NOT use 'full'
